# Assignment Grading

This assignment has a total of **100 points**. Bellow is a table with the description of the item under consideration and the assigned grade _if the item is totally correct_. Partial grade will be considered if the item is not fully correct.

Item     | Value (points)
-------- | :-----:

The following situations may take credits out of your assignment, if they happen during the evaluation process:

Item     | Value (points)
-------- | :-----:
Compiling and/or runtime errors  | -5
Missing code documentation in Doxygen style | -10
Memory leak | -10
[`author.md`](author.md) file not filled out | -10

The [`author.md`](author.md) file should contain a brief description of the project, and how to run it. It also should describe possible errors, limitations, or issues found. Do not forget to include the author name!

# Authorship and Collaboration Policy

This is an **individual assignment**. You may be called for an interview. The purpose of the interview is to confirm the authorship of the assignment and to ask for explanations on specific points of the code. During the interview, you should be capable of explaining any piece of code. After the interview, the assignment’s credits may be reviewed.

The cooperation among students is strongly encouraged. It is accepted the open discussion of ideas or development strategies. Notice, however, that this type of interaction should not be understood as a free permission to copy and use somebody else’s code. This is may be interpreted as plagiarism.

Any two (or more) programs deemed as plagiarism will automatically receive no credits, regardless of the real authorship of the programs involved in the case. If your project uses a (small) piece of code from someone else’s, please provide proper acknowledgment in the [`author.md`](author.md) file.

# Work Submission

You may submit your work in two possible ways: via GitHub Classroom (GHC), or, via Sigaa submission task. In case you decide to send your work via GHC you _must_ also send a text file via Sigaa submission task with the github link to your repository. In case you choose to send your work via Sigaa only, send a zip file containing all the code necessary to compile and run the project.

I any of these two ways, remember to remove all the executable files (i.e. the `build` folder) from your project before handing in your work.
