This is a basic   example of what I can do once     you feed me with interesting stuff to say.

You may also     control my appearance by letting me graze freely in a field as much as I want!
    (hummmm, that's not entirely accurate,       I must say, but I wouldn't mind)

Sometimes I may feel **tired**, other times **wired**, but if you begin to stare at me too intensely, I may become **paranoid**!!!


       Other times I just want     to    say     "muuuuuuuu".
